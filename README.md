# 2D-image-to-3D-Model
 The Goal of this project is to convert  the  2-dimensional colour  image into 3-dimensional model using the Open3d library. Depth Estimation is used to convert the 2-dimensional colour image to Point Clouds and then convert it into 3d Mesh using open3d.
 
 Roles & Responsibilities:
Firstly, Used Depth Estimation to convert Image into Point Clouds.
Convert the Point Clouds into 3D mesh.
Used Ball Pivoting Algorithm and Poisson Surface Reconstruction method using open3d.
Voxel Down-sampling is used to create uniformly down-sampled point clouds.
